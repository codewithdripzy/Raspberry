## ✨ Overview

**Raspberry** is a next-generation UI framework designed to bring **Flutter’s expressive syntax** to the **web**.  
It provides a **declarative component model**, **reactive rendering**, and a **lightweight runtime** that makes building apps fast, fun, and maintainable.

```typescript
// Example: Raspberry widget-based syntax
import { Scaffold, Center, Text, runApp } from "raspberry";

const myApp = Scaffold({
  body: Center({
    child: Text({ 
      text: "Hello Raspberry 🍓", 
      fontSize: "24px", 
      fontWeight: "bold" 
    }),
  }),
});

runApp(myApp, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

## 🚀 Features

* 🧩 **Flutter-like Syntax** — Build web apps using widget-style syntax
* ⚡ **Reactive Runtime** — Efficient, reactive updates without a virtual DOM
* 🛠 **CLI Tooling** — Create, build, and deploy projects easily
* 📦 **Monorepo Packages** — Core, CLI, Devtools, and Integrations
* 🌈 **Developer Friendly** — Fast builds, hot reload, and modular structure
