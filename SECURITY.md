## ⚠️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Raspberry, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it responsibly to our private security team:

📧 **security@raspberry.dev**

(Replace with your real security contact email or GitHub Security Advisories link.)

Please include:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if possible)  
- Your environment details (OS, Node.js version, etc.)  
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations  

We aim to acknowledge all reports **within 48 hours** and provide a response or fix **within a reasonable timeframe** depending on severity.

## 🧰 Coordinated Disclosure Process

1. You report the issue privately (via email or GitHub Security Advisory).  
2. We confirm receipt and begin investigation.  
3. If valid, we work on a fix and prepare an advisory.  
4. Once a fix is available, we release an update and publicly disclose the issue with credit to the reporter (if desired).

## 🧑‍💻 Security Best Practices

- Review third-party code before including it in your project.  
- Follow [OWASP security best practices](https://owasp.org/Top10/) for web applications.

## 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure

We strongly support responsible disclosure and will **never take legal action** against security researchers who follow the process above in good faith.
